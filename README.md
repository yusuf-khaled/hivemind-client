# HiveMind Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

Make sure the backend is up and running first.

Then run `npm i --force` (had some dependency resolution errors I didn't want to spend time debugging).

Then `npm start` and the app will be running in `localhost:3000`.
